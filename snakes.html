        <p>There are over 3,400 known species of snake in the world. They have been found on every continent except Antartica. There are roughly 250 snake species in just the United States, only four of which are venemous. I guess that makes us pretty lucky compared to other countries. South Africa has a very special snake, the Black Mamba. Just two drops of venom from this serpent can kill a human!</p>

    <h3>Rattlesnakes</h3>
        <p>Rattlesnakes are one of the most common serpents found in the United States. They are best known for their rattling tail, thus the name, and their venomous bite. They live in almost every region of the US but are mostly found in areas such as Texas, New Mexico, and Nevada. They can be found in a variety of habitats, not just deserts contrary to popular belief, such as swamps, forests, and grasslands. Rattlesnakes can even swim!</p>
        <ul><b>Random Fun Facts</b>

            <li class="facts">They can only strike from a coiled position, this is where they get the power necessary for a well placed bite.</li>
            <li class="facts">Rattlesnakes are what we call a pit viper, meaning they have heat sensing organs in the pits of their eyes that allow them to see the heat signature of their prey even in complete darkness.</li>
            <li class="facts">Adult rattlesnakes can last longer on one meal than the average human, they only need to eat once every two weeks.</li>

        <br><h3 class="h3-boa">Boa Constrictors</h3>
        <p>Boa Constrictors are found in regions from Northern Mexico to Argentina. There are many breeds of Boas, but the Constrictor lives in the largest variety of habitats such as tropical forests, savannas, and even cultivated fields. Constrictors are incredible swimmers, although they greatly prefer dry land. Boa Constrictors come in a wide variety of colors and patterns depending on their habitat. Some colors include tan, green, red, or yellow, and some patterns include diamons, bars, and circles.</p>
        <ul><b>Random Fun Facts</b> 
            <li class="facts">Constrictors can reach lengths of 13 feet by adulthood and can weigh over 100 pounds.</li>
            <li class="facts">They can live up to 30 years in the wild</li>
            <li class="facts">Some smaller breeds in South America are used for pest control inside homes, they rarely attack humans because even human babies are too large of prey for a constrictor.</li>
            <li class="facts">Constrictors are a nonvenomous snake that have small, hooked teeth to latch onto their prey while they wrap their bodies around the prey to crush them and cause "circulatory arrest", cutting off the circulatory system.</li>

    <h3>Ball Pythons</h3>
        <p>Ball pythons are one of the least harmful snakes and, as such, are the most common choice for pets, alongside cornsnakes. Ball pythons are the smallest breed of pythons found in Africa. They are extremely docile creatures that are very easy to handle, especially when bred in captivity. Their name comes from a particular defense mechanism that allows them to almost literally be rolled around like a ball. When these small reptiles are stressed or afraid they will coil themselves into a tight ball with their head and tail tucked in the middle.</p>
        <ul><b>Random Fun Facts</b>
            <li class="facts">Ball Pythons reach a maximum length of about six feet, the females can reach larger lengths the males.</li>
            <li class="facts">These pythons go by another name, the "Royal Python", due to the belief that ancient rulers in Africa, like Cleopatra, would wear them like jewelry.</li>
            <li class="facts">Ball pythons are a type of constrictor, using similar tactics as the Boa Constrictor to kill its prey.</li>

    <!--added conclusion to wrap up and reiterate main statement-->
    <h3>To Conclude</h3>
        <p>There are a wide variety of snakes in the world that can range from highly agressive to extremely docile. Some snakes have strong toxins to protect themselves and help digest their prey, and some have even been known to eat live prey, such as Garter snakes, although these snakes will go after defensless prey such as frogs and fish to avoid internal damage from their food. One common trait that all snakes share is that they will not attack a human unless they absolutely must. They are a bit like bees in this sense, if they can avoid you they will. Most recorded snake bites were a result of human error, causing the snake to become defensive. Remember, they are just as afraid of you as you are of them. Be kind to snakes, give them space and they will give you space.</p>
