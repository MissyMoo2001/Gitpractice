        <p>Key lime pie is classic summer pie that originated in the southeastern areas of the United States. The exact origins of this Southern favorite are unknown, with some believing it originated from a "Magic Lemon Cream Pie" published by Borden, a producer of sweetened condensed milk in the 1930's, and others believing a cook called Aunt Sally had made it for a millionaire in Key West, Florida in the 19th century. Whatever the story may be, key lime pie is wonderful summer classic that can be enjoyed on a hot summer day or even make a great addition to a christmas party.</p>
        <p>Key lime pie only takes a few ingredients and a short cook time in the oven, making it perfect last minute plans or spur of the moment cravings. Using juice and rinds from the small key limes for that summery flavor and sweetened condensed milk to sweeten it up, all you have left to do is combine these ingredients in a graham cracker pie crust, bake for a few minutes, and chill before serving. Most recipes, the older recipes, call for eggs to make the thick, creamy texture. But I have found an equally simple recipe that just calls for a little sour cream instead. Once you've combined and baked these ingredients you can top off your treat with some whipped cream, a <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/19796/good-meringue/">meringue</a>, or even just some small key lime slices for garnish. This pie pairs nicely with a lemonade, iced tea, or a cold glass of milk to wash it down. Just follow the recipe I have provided below and enjoy a nice treat in minutes! I will even provide links for other wonderful recipes and a chance for you to share some of your favorites with me!</p>
