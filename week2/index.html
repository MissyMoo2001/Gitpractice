    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <img height="200px" src="https://www.zoocreatures.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/snakes-available.jpg">
    <p>Roughly one third of the adult population has a fear of snakes, 3-4% of adults have a clinical fear of snakes. Most people find their long, limbless bodies and ability to eat an animal larger than itself in one swallow terrifying. Not to mention the number of snakes that can kill a human with just one venomous bite. But I think they get a really bad wrap. Despite their cold blooded-ness, snakes can be very sweet animals with mild manners and kind personalities. They can make great pets for anyone who understands them, and knows what their doing. If you treat a snake with enough love and respect they can sometimes behave like dogs with happy go lucky personalities and curious natures. On the other hand, if you don't take good care of a snake they may be more apt to become antisocial and lash out when you go near them.</p>

    <p>Lots of people own snakes, some even dress theirs up in tiny hats like this one. Look at that little cowboy!</p><br>

    <h3>How Dangerous are they?</h3>
    <p>While death by snakebite is uncommon, there have been cases where a victim required a lifesaving amputation. Interestingly, of the wide range of known snake species only 250 are able to kill a human with one bite. This, paired with snakes typically avoiding humans, can explain the uncommonality of death by snake bite fairly well. Most snakes around the world can still give a nasty infection, however. Most serpents jaws are designed more for latching on to prey than incapacitating, or killing, them, these snakes will have small rows of teeth rather than large fangs. If you happen to get bit by a snake and don't know if it was venomous or not just wait 30 to 60 minutes and watc for redness, swelling, or oozing. Alternatively, you can also check the pattern of the bite mark. If you see just one row of marks with two large holes in the middle, this snake was venomous. If you see two rows of marks and no larger holes, this one was not. I would still recommend watching for swelling however, some people are allergic to the bacteria in snakes' mouths depending what the serpent ate.</p>
    <p>Here is a chart of some of the most venomous snakes and where they come from. The snakes listed are the top three most feared snakes in the world, The locations given for each is simply its native home, the doseage listed is the maximum recorded doseage of each, and the final number is simply how many adults that dose <u>could</u> kill. Please note that while the Inland Tiapan is number one on this list, there are no recorded deaths by this snake.</p>
